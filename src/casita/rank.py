"""Rank listings by fit.

Heuristic baseline. Higher score = better.

Inputs are weighted in line with stated priorities, in priority order:
  - Dogs OK (large or any-size) — gate; no-dogs heavily penalized
  - Walk-to-Presidio (trail access) — primary
  - Walk-to-beach — secondary
  - 3 bedrooms preferred, ≥ 1.5 baths preferred
  - In-unit laundry > shared > hookups
  - Garage parking > street > none

Walking times come from the `walk_map` populated by walk.populate_for().
When None, score is computed without those terms.
